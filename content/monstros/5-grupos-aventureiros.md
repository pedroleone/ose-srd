This procedure generates parties of NPC adventurers. As the procedure is fairly involved, referees may wish to pre-generate some NPC parties for use in random encounters. The following general details apply to all types of NPC party described:

* **Spells**: If spell casters are present, choose or roll their memorized spells.
* **Equipment**: Normal adventuring gear.
* **Treasure**: Treasure types U+V, shared among the group.
* **Marching order**: Decided by referee.

If the classes presented in this document are not in use, the referee should replace the listed classes by equivalents in use in the campaign. 

# Basic Adventurers

* **Composition**: 1d4+4 characters of random class and level (see below).
* **Alignment**: Either roll the alignment of each NPC or roll once for the party.

# Expert Adventurers

* **Composition**: 1d6+3 characters of random class and level (see below).
* **Alignment**: Either roll the alignment of each NPC or roll once for the party.
* **Mounts**: 75% chance of being mounted, in the wilderness.
* **Magic items**: Per individual: there is a chance of the NPC having a magic item from each suitable magic item sub-table (see Magic Items). The chance per sub-table is 5% per level of the NPC. Rolled items that cannot be used by the NPC should be ignored (no re-roll).

# High-Level Cleric

A high-level cleric and party. (Mounts and magic items as per Expert Adventurers.)

* **Composition**: Leader (cleric of level 1d6+6), 1d4 clerics (level 1d4+1), 1d3 fighters (level 1d6).
* **Alignment**: Roll for the whole party.

# High-Level Fighter

A high-level fighter and a group of retainers, often on their way to or from war. (Mounts and magic items as per Expert Adventurers.)

* **Composition**: Leader (fighter of level 1d4+6), 2d4 retainers (level 1d4+2, any class).
* **Alignment**: Roll for the whole party.

# High-Level Magic-User

A high-level magic-user, accompanied by their apprentices and a group of hired guards, often on a quest for arcane lore. (Mounts and magic items as per Expert Adventurers.)

* **Composition**: Leader (magic-user of level 1d4+6), 1d4 apprentices (magic-users of level 1d3), 1d4 mercenaries (fighters of level 1d4+1).
* **Alignment**: Roll the leader’s alignment. The apprentices have the same alignment as the leader, but the mercenaries may be of different alignment.
